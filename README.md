# McGee Lab

**Experiments • Tools • Systems**

McGeeLab is my personal lab for building software, hardware, and creative systems.  
It serves as a central hub for experiments, tools, and long-term projects that live at the intersection of engineering, automation, and making.

## What is McGee Lab?

McGeeLab isn’t a single product or framework — it’s a working space.

It’s where I:
- prototype ideas   
- build internal tools
- explore system design
- connect software and physical hardware
- document projects that don’t fit neatly into one category

Some projects grow into full products or studios. Others remain experiments. All of them live here.
